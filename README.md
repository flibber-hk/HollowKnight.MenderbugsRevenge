# Menderbug's Revenge

Mod that kills you whenever you break a background object (includes normal breakables as well as Fog Canyon bubbles, infection bubbles, ground grass and hanging cloths).

Toggle between death, 1 damage and no effect as the punishment for breaking something in the mod menu.

Notes: there are a few surprising gotchas to watch out for:
* There's a breakable pole behind the baldur between Crossroads and Greenpath. The first three fireballs will be blocked by the baldur, but the one that kills the baldur will continue past it and break the pole. It's possible to avoid breaking it by jumping before shooting the last fireball, but it's somewhat tight. Alternatives would be to use longnail or dreamshield to finish off the baldur, or simply die there and come back.
* There's a bubble at the right entrance to the Fog Canyon Acid room before Queen's Gardens ("QGA room"). That means it's impossible to enter this room while the mod is active.
* There's a hanging vine in the spike corridor on the way to Broken Vessel. It's possible to make it through without a shade skip, but you have to pogo to the geo rock and then cdash the rest of the way.
* There's a hanging cloth at the bottom of Teacher's Archives that will break on cdash, meaning that one of Monarch Wings, Isma's Tear or Dreamgate is required to escape. With just wings of the three, the escape is very tight.
* It's possible to get to Isma's Tear without a shade skip - cdashing from the very bottom of the wall with the crystal (in the room past the spike tunnel) will allow you to get there without breaking the crystal; it's very tight though.
* It's possible to get to Watcher's Spire without the background pogo or getting wings, by shade skipping - either die by breaking a background object, or die on the elevator spikes.
* Watch out for breakables in the boss arenas, particularly Hornet 1 and Broken Vessel's arenas.
* Because of how the mod is implemented, if you activate invincibility in debug, break something, and then deactivate it, you'll die. Toggling action on death will prevent any queued deaths though.
